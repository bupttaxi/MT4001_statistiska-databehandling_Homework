# a brief description of your past experiences, if any, of using R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git, Github, ggplot2 and dplyr
I can say that I almost do not have any past experiences in R, but I have used Github before this course. So It is a lot of things to learn in R for me.

# a plot, using ggplot, of some aspect of a data-set. 
I use this table gotten from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awodijitemitope/steps-count-for-fitness-journey-dataset". 
It is a raw .csv file to record training data of a person every day.
I this plot, we can see steps and calories is almost linear correlated with each other, which makes sense!
So it proves that the more steps the more calories are consumed.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
Steps_daily <- read_csv("Steps Export_ 3-17-21to9-23-22.csv")
ggplot(Steps_daily, aes(x=Step_Count, y=Calories))+geom_point()

sessionInfo()

```
